# slamko — System map (how the modules interact, now & next)

<!-- validated: 2026-05-27 (P2 CLOSED · P4a) · tests: core 26 + fusion 4 + vio 24 + loop 32 gtest 0 fail · gtsam tracks MH_01 · never-lost seal→branch→WELD→recover + MULTI-SUBMAP pose-graph merge (2 disjoint sealed) validated live on V1_01 (XFeat, auto-check 7/7) · SE3 pose-graph + stress + weld-once + disjoint submaps + SubMap serialization (P4a) -->

The one-page projection of the whole system. A **map, not a textbook** — it states
what's true now + where it's headed, and is corrected as code lands. Deep detail
lives next to the code (header "why" blocks) and in each package's `docs/STATUS.md`.
Read [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) + [`../MASTER_PLAN.md`](../MASTER_PLAN.md) +
[`DECOUPLING.md`](DECOUPLING.md) alongside this.

**This file is the cold-start orientation map** — start here to locate any module,
its state, and where its notes live. Skim the table below, then dive into the
package's `README.md` → `docs/STATUS.md` → `docs/PLAN_<phase>.md`.

## Status at a glance — "where are we"

One row per package; updated when a milestone lands (detail in each `docs/STATUS.md`).
✅ shipped · 🟢 active · ⬜ planned/deferred.

**Active next task:** **TUM VI** (multi-floor). Fisheye→pinhole rectifier shipped
(`scripts/rectify_tumvi.py`); `room1` gate **green** (maps coherently, Sim3-ATE 69 cm,
drift = no-loop-closure). New interactive default viz `scripts/plot_slamko.py` (Plotly 3D).
Rectified bags + full method: `/mnt/data/datasets/tumvi_rect/README.md`. Plan:
[`PLAN_TUMVI_RECTIFY.md`](PLAN_TUMVI_RECTIFY.md) — next: magistrale single → multi-part
cross-session merge.

**Visual results** (anchor-corrected merges, rendered by `scripts/plot_neverlost.py`,
gated by `scripts/check_neverlost.py`): [`figures/multi_submap_merge_V1_01.png`](figures/multi_submap_merge_V1_01.png)
(never-lost recovery + multi-submap merge) · [`figures/cross_session_V1_02_into_V1_01.png`](figures/cross_session_V1_02_into_V1_01.png)
(cross-session: a different trajectory localized into a prior map). See the README "Results" section.

**External integration** (robot stack, *not* slamko packages): D455 driver / sim
(`cerebro_robot_sim`) / EuRoC bag → `slamko_ros` inputs; `slamko_ros` → Nav2 + TF
downstream. The wider workspace is mapped in [`~/coding/CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md).

```

**Two graphs (locked).** A *fast* bounded local smoother (Tier 2) for real-time
pose, and a *separate async* global graph (Tier 3) for consistency/loop-closure/
recovery. The fast odometry **never depends on** the slow global graph — so the
global graph is disposable (can be damped, torn, rebuilt from odometry) without ever
stalling the tracker.

**Three TF owners, never overlapping.** vio/fusion own `odom→base`; loop owns
`map→odom`; `slamko_ros` is the only place that publishes the composed tree. Nothing
else writes TF (the OKVIS2-X "one owner per transform" rule).

**The two types that cross tiers:** `EstimationFrame` (Tier 2→3) and `SubMap`
(Tier 3 unit), each with a `custom_data` escape hatch so the pipeline extends without
changing the interface. Everything else is package-internal.

## Threading doctrine (locked — OKVIS2-X + GLIM)

- **Single-writer per graph.** Each graph (local, global) has exactly one writer
  thread. No shared-mutable graph state across threads.
- **Cross-thread requests = atomic flags, consumed at ONE race-free point** — after
  the optimize() join, never mid-solve. A deferral backlog is replayed on merge.
- **Bounded queues with back-pressure, never stall.** A slow global thread drops/
  coalesces, it does not block the hot path.
- Thread map: `slamko_vio` = fast hot thread (per-frame, µs budget) · `slamko_fusion`
  = local-graph thread (keyframe rate) · `slamko_loop` = async/disposable thread
  (place-rec + recovery, best-effort).

## The never-lost spine (3 timescales × where it lives)

| Timescale | Mechanism | Lives in | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| ms–0.5 s (blur/occlusion) | IMU / const-vel+gyro **dead-reckoning** | `slamko_vio` | ✅ ported (klt_vo) |
| seconds–minutes (medium loss) | **archive-don't-discard**: seal submap → branch fresh → keep emitting odom | `slamko_loop` supervisor | P2 |
| long loss / kidnap | **relocalize** (LiftFeat-m1 + DBoW) → **weld** with one relative-pose constraint | `slamko_loop` `Relocalizer` | P2/P3 |

**Loss trigger = odometry stale-gap** (`HealthSignal.odom_stale_gap_s`), wall-clock/
monotonic — NOT a covariance spike. A blackout *pauses* odom; it does not inflate
covariance (the OKVIS2-X finding). The covariance/eigenvalue fields in `HealthSignal`
are degeneracy monitors, not the primary loss signal.

## Two principles that are code-paths, not slogans

- **Degradation = covariance, not a branch.** A degraded modality is a `Factor` with
  inflated `sqrt_information()`; its weight shrinks toward zero and the optimizer
  down-weights it automatically. There is no `if(sensor_ok)` anywhere.
- **The global graph is disposable.** The backend catches the optimizer's
  indeterminant-system exception, damps the offending variable, and rebuilds missing
  nodes/edges from the still-trusted odometry. A bad loop closure damps, never crashes.

## Health flow

`slamko_core` defines the *signals* (`HealthSignal`, `HealthReporter`). `slamko_vio`
and `slamko_fusion` *emit* them (stale-gap, min-eigenvalue, marginal-cov, inlier
ratio). `slamko_loop` owns the *policy* — the Good/Marginal/Lost state machine,
watchdogs, recovery triggers. Signals and policy are deliberately split so the
supervisor can gate recovery **outside** the estimator graph (tight in-graph coupling
"pendulates").

## Contract vs implementation (the evolution map)

**Stable contracts** (change rarely, everything depends on them): the `slamko_core`
interfaces — `Factor`, `SensorFrontend`, `FactorGraphBackend`, `FeatureSource`,
`FeatureTracker`, `Matcher`, `Relocalizer` — plus the `slamko_msgs` map-server API.

**Swappable implementations** (add/replace freely, nothing else changes): every
`*Source` (ShiTomasi / XFeat / LiftFeat-m1), every `*Backend` (Ceres / GTSAM), every
`Relocalizer`, every sensor frontend. Swap one by registering a different impl in the
`slamko_ros` composition root — no other package edits.

**How the deferred packages slot in without touching existing code:**
- `slamko_mapping` (P4): `SubMap` persistence behind the map-server contract.
- `slamko_sensors` (P5): a wheel/LiDAR/GPS frontend = `registerFrontend(new WheelFrontend(T_BS))`. The backend never names a sensor.
- `slamko_semantic` (P6): object-level `Factor`s (quadric/cuboid) on the same graph.

That "register a frontend / backend / relocalizer, never a rewrite" property is the
whole point of the `slamko_core` seam (DigiForest/VILENS decoupling).

## Glossary (load-bearing terms)

- **T_WB** — body-in-world pose, the standard pose node; each sensor carries its own `T_BS` (sensor-in-body).
- **Factor** — `{keys, residual, √information, robust_kernel}`; the unit of fusion and of pluggability.
- **SubMap** — self-contained, serializable chunk of the global map (KF poses + landmarks + descriptor index + anchor); the unit of archive-don't-discard.
- **Marginalization** — dropping old nodes via Schur complement → a linear prior on the separator, with **FEJ** (First-Estimates Jacobian) for consistency. Replaces lossy gauge-by-constant.
- **Stale-gap** — seconds since the odometry stream last advanced; the loss trigger.
- **Weld** — re-anchoring an archived submap to the live one with a single relative-pose constraint after a relocalization hit.
